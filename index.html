        <h1>Welcome to Student-Senior Tech Connections</h1>
        <p class = "center"> We the Tech Savvy Teens, or TEST want to help pair today's teens
          with senior citizens who are having technological problems, in order to
          better their lives. Many elderly people have trouble with todayâ€™s technology
          and it can be frustrating and troublesome. This can affect them in many
          ways, like making it difficult for them to reach out to family and friends, and
          making them more susceptible to scamming and malicious attacks.
          This program will help the teens gain community service hours by
          meeting with our senior citizens to help them better understand how to use
          technology, or to fix their technological issues. We understand that some
          senior citizens will find it difficult to use our application, to counter this we
          will implement other ways of reaching out to them, or those close to them.
          Our application will work with high schools and senior citizen centers to find
          students who are willing and eager to help senior citizens.</p>
